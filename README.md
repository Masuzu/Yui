Collection of data structures, algorithms and other puzzles:
- BST with predecessor and successor access in constant time
- RB tree (rebalancing is done through a constant number of node rotations, contrary to AVL trees)
- Heap and heap sort. Merge sort
- Radix tree implementation with insertion, deletion, search and auto-completion functionality based on the Damerau-Levenshtein distance
- Quick select (finds the kth minimum element in average linear time)
- Segment tree for logarithmic minimum retrieval in 1D range 
- Minimum Range Query in constant time after a preprocessing step in linear time
- Lowest Common Ancestor in constant time after a preprocessing step in linear time
- Egg-breaking problem, Hanoi tower, Skyline problem
